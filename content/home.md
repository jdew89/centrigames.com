Ruthless Merchants is a marketplace full of cunning and unruly characters. The goal of the game is simple: collect coins. But, why is it a “ruthless” marketplace, you ask? Many actions have devious intentions.

In this tabletop game, you will choose one of the six ruthless characters to compete against your fellow merchants. Collect your coins peacefully or come out with punches blazing! But, watch out for other merchants--they can knock the coins right out of your pockets. Is all the action starting to make you dizzy? Lay down, take a nap and you’ll feel good as new in no time!

This family-friendly game is designed for 3-6 players and takes approximately one hour to play. It always brings out the feistiness in people!
