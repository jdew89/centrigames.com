Centri Games is a board game designer based in Canton, Ohio. My name is Jeff DeWitt, and I am the owner of Centri Games and creator of Ruthless Merchants. Gaming has always been part of my life. Since I was a child, my Father and I would play a lot of board games and create our own games to play with each other. It was always fun to be creative and test new ideas. 

Ruthless Merchants was just another "fun idea" when I came up with it in 2019 with my wife. Since then, I decided it was time to share one of my creations with the world. I hope you get as much joy out of the game as I have creating it!
